# 3D Artist Scripts
A collection of scripts for working on 3D art projects.

These scripts are meant to be used from the command line (cmd) in Windows.

To make them available for execution from the terminal, you will need to create a scripts folder to store these scripts, and then add that folder path to your system path.

For example:
1. Create a folder "C:/Users/<username>/scripts"
2. Add the scripts from this repo in that scripts folder 
3. Start typing "path" in your windows menu and pick "Edit your environment variables"
4. In the pop-up, select "Path" under user variables and click "Edit..."
5. Add "C:/Users/<username>/scripts" in the end of the list either by double-clicking or selecting "New"
6. Hit "ok"
  
Next time you open the command line, you should be able to run the scripts from above as commands. For instance you should be able to run "createZPR".
